## Data science and machine learning lessons from the Titanic analysis   
This was my first kaggle competition and I learned a lot about the data science process - from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model prediction using various machine learning algorithms.   
1. Cleaning / wrangling data is very important. It's also time consuming... But it's essential to understand your data well.   
2. Feature engineering, or the process of choosing relevant variables - either existing ones or combining them to create new ones - can easily be the most important factor in determining the success of your predictive model. Taking the time up front to visualize and find good features will pay off later on in the prediction phase.
