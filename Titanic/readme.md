## Data science and machine learning lessons from the Titanic analysis   
This was my first kaggle competition and I learned a lot about the data science process - from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model prediction using various machine learning algorithms.   
1. Cleaning / wrangling data is very important. Feature engineering, or the process of choosing relevant variables - either existing ones or creating new ones - can easily be the most important factor in determining the success of your predictive model.
