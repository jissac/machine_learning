# Statistical Learning

## About this course
The course follows closely the sequence of chapters in the course text "An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2013). Remember, this textbook is available for free online at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/.     

The first week will be an overview of Statistical Learning, and will cover the first two chapters of the book. On each subsequent Saturday we will release the materials for a new chapter. Here is the schedule in detail:
